# Enhanced Bitswap/GraphSync with more Network Smarts

## Short Description
> In one sentence or paragraph.

Bitswap is a simple protocol and it generally works. However, we feel that *its performance can be substantially improved*. One of the main factors that hold performance back is the fact that *a node cannot request a subgraph of the DAG and results in many round-trips in order to “walk down” the DAG*. The current operation of bitswap is also very often linked to *duplicate transmission and receipt of content which overloads both the end nodes and the network*.

## Long Description

IPFS starts by resolving the CID to a peerID and further to the exact location of the node that stores the requested content. It then uses a very simple protocol called bitswap to exchange content between the requestor and the server.

In particular, IPFS asks Bitswap for the blocks corresponding to a set of CIDs. Upon this request, Bitswap sends a request for the CIDs to all of its directly connected peers. If none of the node's directly connected peers have one or more of the requested blocks, Bitswap falls back to querying the DHT for the root node of the DAG. That said, Bitswap also participates in the discovery phase and not only in the actual block exchange.

In order to synchronise a DAG between untrusted nodes, bitswap is exploiting the content-addressability feature of IPFS. This means that bitswap starts with the root hash of the DAG. Once it fetches the data, it verifies that its hash matches. The node can now trust this block and can thus continue with the rest of the blocks in the DAG (aka walk the DAG) until it gets the complete DAG and the data associated with it.

In the current implementation of bitswap, requesting nodes send their WANT lists to all the peers they are directly connected to. This results in potentially duplicate data being sent back to the receiving node. When the receiving node has received the block(s) it asked for, it sends a CANCEL message to its peers to let them know that the block(s) is not in its WANT list anymore.

If none of the directly connected peers have any of the WANT list blocks, bitswap falls back to the DHT to find the requested content. This results in long delays to get to a peer that stores the requested content.

Once the recipient node starts receiving content from multiple peer nodes, bitswap prioritises sending WANT lists to the peers with lower latencies. Current proposals within the IPFS ecosystem are considering prioritising sending the WANT lists to those nodes with the least amount of queued work, in the hope that this will result in higher througput. It is not clear at this point which approach will lead to the highest performance benefit.

It is important to highlight that bitswap is a message-oriented protocol and _not_ a request-response protocol. That is, it sends messages including WANT lists and is then waiting for the blocks in the WANT list to be delivered back, as and when the discovery protocol manages to find the blocks in the WANT list.


This process of bitswap results in the following major problems:

- **Many Roundtrips:** The most pressing issue is that requesting nodes have to make several roundtrips to walk the DAG, especially given that IPFS is a network run by untrusted nodes.
- **Duplicate Data:** Bitswap is operating at the block level. In turn, this means that every block has to be requested from each peer that the node is connected to. This process results in duplicate traffic towards the data requestor, unnecessary load for the peers, and high overhead for the network.

In the latest release of Bitswap there is an optimisation of the above procedure that incorporates the concept of Sessions. Sessions are used to keep track of peers that have some of the blocks that the Session is interested in. In particular:

- When IPFS asks Bitswap for the blocks corresponding to a set of CIDs, Bitswap:
  - creates a new sessions
  - starts a discovery phase to find the peers with a subset of the blocks.
- As peers are discovered they are remembered by the Session. Bitswap _divides_ subsequent requests _between peers_ in a session. That is, it _does not_ ask every peer for every block, it asks a subset of the peers in the session (usually 1-2) for each block
- If there is a timeout, the Session tries to discover more peers through the DHT.

### Within the IPFS Ecosystem
> Existing attempts and strategies

The IPFS community has long been aware of the issues of bitswap and has experimented (at least conceptually) with potential solutions. We are discussing some of them here:

- *Parallelise the DAG walk.* Inherently, DAGs have one root node and then split into binary trees. Doing one walk for each of the branches results in the same number of round trips, but reduces the actual delay in half. Clearly, this approach does not apply for single-branch graphs, such as blockchains.

- *DAG Block Interconnection.* Although bitswap does not/cannot recognise any relationship between different blocks of the same DAG, a requesting node can ask a node that provided a previous block for subsequent blocks of the same DAG. This approach intuitively assumes that a node that has a block of a DAG is very likely to have others. This is often referred to as “session” between the peers that have provided some part of the DAG.

- *Latency & Throughput Optimisation.* Bitswap is currently sorting peers by latency, i.e., it is prioritising the connections that incur lower latency. Ideally, a hybrid approach needs to be implemented, where prioritisation based on latency applies to narrow but deep DAGs (e.g., blockchains), whereas prioritisation based on higher throughput applies to wide DAGs that are being traversed in parallel.

- *Coding and Reed Solomon Codes.* This is a very efficient way to reduce storage space in general (trusted or untrusted) caching systems. The area of coded caching has seen significant development lately in the research community, hence, it is discussed further down.

- *GraphSync through IPLD selectors:* GraphSync is a specification of a protocol to synchronise graphs across peers. Graphsync answers the question of “how do we succinctly identify selectors connected to the root”. In doing that, it develops WANT lists of selectors instead of blocks. Furthermore, in contrast to bitswap, which is message-oriented, GraphSync includes responses and is thus closer to a request-response protocol. If designed carefully, GraphSync can be very effective but there are still unresolved challenges: i) it is more difficult to parallelise (see above), given that GraphSync operates in terms of requests and not blocks, ii) it can potentially be much easier to carry DDoS attacks with queries than with requests for blocks.

- *WANT Potential and HAVE message.* There have been several optimisation proposals, such as the implementation of a HAVE message before actually sending the requested block back. Although this immediately reduces duplicate traffic, it introduces one extra RTT, which might not be desirable in some cases, but might not have any negative impact in many others. In particular, the new message types are:

  - HAVE: a node can indicate that it has a block, which helps with reducing duplication, particularly during the discovery phase.
  - DONT_HAVE: a node can immediately indicate that it does not have a block. This is in contrast to the current implementation, where the requesting node has to wait for a timeout.

In the latest proof-of-concept implementation, the following message combinations are being implemented as optimisation steps:

  - WANT-BLOCK: *"send the block if you have it"*. This is an attempt to avoid the extra RTT.
  - WANT-HAVE: *"let me know if you have the block"*. This is to avoid duplication and help disseminate knowledge of block distribution in the network.
  
This way, the WANT-BLOCK messages are directed to the peers that are most likely to have those blocks.

### Within the broad Research Ecosystem
> How do people try to solve this problem?

*Bittorrent*

The bittorrent protocol has a different architectural design, which includes the “tracker” that keeps track of chunks per node and coordinates what is downloaded from which node. The design is substantially different to the IPFS, but included some interesting policies, such as fetch “Rarest First”, “Random First” and “Endgame Mode”, which is a greedy mode to collect all the chunks that a node has not managed to find yet.

*Coded Caching*

There have been significant research efforts lately in the area of coded caching. The main concept has been proposed in 1960s in the form of error correction and targeted the area of content delivery over wireless, lossy channels. It has been known as Reed-Solomon error correction. Lately, with seminal works such as “Fundamental Limits of Caching”, Niesen et. al. have proposed the use of coding to improve caching performance. In a summary, the technique works as follows: if we have a file that consists of 10 chunks and we store all 10 chunks in the same or different memories/nodes, then we need to retrieve those exact 10 chunks in order to reconstruct the file.

In contrast, according to the coded caching theory, before storing the 10 chunks, we encode the file using erasure codes. This results in some number of chunks x>10, say 13, for the sake of illustration. This clearly results in more data produced after adding codes to the original data. However, when attempting to retrieve the original file, a user needs to collect *any 10 of those 13 chunks*. By doing so, the user will be able to reconstruct the original file, without needing to get all 13 chunks. 

Although such approach does not save bandwidth (we still need to reconstruct 10 chunks of equal size to the original one), it makes the network more resilient to nodes being unavailable. In other words, in order to reconstruct the original file without coding, all 10 of the original peers that store a file have to be online and ready to deliver the chunks, whereas in the coded caching case, any 10 out of the 13 peers need to be available and ready to provide the chunks. Possibly more importantly, coded caching can provide significant performance benefits in terms of load-balancing. In case of large files, the upload link of nodes will be saturated for long periods of time. In contrast, delivering a few coded chunks and gathering the rest from other nodes will load-balance between nodes that store the requested content.

Blind replication of the original object will not provide the same benefit, as the number of peers will need to be much higher (at least 20 as compared to 13) in order to operate with the same satisfaction ratio.

### Known shortcomings of existing solutions
> What are the limitations on those solutions?

The shortcomings of the current bitswap protocol have been discussed above in the State of the Art section. GraphSync is a very promising next step, which however, comes with its own challenges, also discussed above.

The approaches that bittorrent has used need to be evaluated, but always keeping in mind that its architecture is different and based on a (logically) centralised tracker.

Coded caching on the other hand incurs some overhead, which might not be ideal for several use-cases of the IPFS system (e.g., popular content), but very convenient for others (cold storage).

## Solving this Open Problem

### What is the impact

Bitswap is a central component of the IPFS system and a protocol that generally influences the performance of IPFS as a whole. Designing and integrating smart algorithmic solutions to improve its performance can be instrumental for the performance and adoption of IPFS. It is worth highlighting that bitswap allows ample space for improvement, hence, several different solutions are encouraged and will be considered. Addressing sub-graphs of the DAG through IPLD as GraphSync is attempting to do in a secure manner is a first necessary step.

### What defines a complete solution?
> What hard constraints should it obey? Are there additional soft constraints that a solution would ideally obey?

First and foremost, any complete solution should account for extensibility as the IPFS system needs to scale up and more applications are implemented on top. The active number of users of IPFS is increasing exponentially and the requests submitted to the network are following accordingly. That being said and acknowledging the fact that it is often difficult to find "one size fits all" solutions, tunable versions of bitswap that can dynamically adapt according to network and environment conditions is an avenue that needs to be explored.

There are several desirable features discussed within IPFS that should be implemented in a complete solution for bitswap and its successor GraphSync - see list below in Existing Conversations/Threads section. Some of them target clean protocol extensions, while some others target higher-level measurement and UI/UX issues.
