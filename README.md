# IPFS Research Repository

## What's in This Repo?

This repo contains all exploratory research work and prototyping for inclusion in IPFS.  

**Disclaimer:** While we work hard to document our work as it progresses, research progress may not be fully reflected here for some time, or may be worked out out-of-band.

## Key Open Problems

We break down a few of the Key Open Problems of high priority for the project in this repo. Some have open [RFPs](https://github.com/protocol/research-rfps#rfps-and-grants). For all, we welcome any collaborations (potentially leading to new constructions, discoveries and publications). Please reach out at research@protocol.ai.

**List:**
- Currently all in [PRs](https://github.com/ipfs/research/pulls)

## Funding

[Protocol Labs runs an RFP (Request For Proposals)](https://github.com/protocol/research-rfps) Program with the goal of funding individuals and groups to come up with novel solutions to the Open Problems found in this and other repos. If interested, please follow the link to check the active RFPs.
